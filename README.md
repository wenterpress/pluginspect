# pluginspect
PHP Class to inspect and report information about Wordpress Plugins

## Installation

**This plugin is under initial development.**  The intention is to eventually install the latest version with: 

````bash
$ composer require wenterpress/pluginspect
````

For now, if you want to install pluginspect, copy the source files into a place where a [psr-3](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/) or greater autoloader is operating.

## Other Requirements

This software requires PHP 7 and the [php-ast](https://github.com/nikic/php-ast) library developed by [Nikita Popov](https://github.com/nikic).  Follow the instructions at that library to make sure that the requirements are followed.
